# Test Package

__work in progress to create a test package__  

This docstring is found in the \__init__.py file of the main package.  

We could use this to not only initialize whatever might need to be initialized by the program,
but also to initialize end-users to the purposes of the package itself.  

In addition, we can use markdown here to really __spruce__ up our introduction!
